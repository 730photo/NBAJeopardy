# NBAJeopardy-redo-

<h5>For project #1, I created a simple game of Jeopardy. 

-Once players come to the site the game is already loaded and they can start playing immediately.

-The game starts when the user clicks on a rectangle and a question pops up. If the user puts in the right answer they gain points, if they put in the wrong answer, they lose points.

-once you click on a rectangle, you can't click on it again.

-How many points are gined or lost is determined by the rectangle they click on.

-questions on the 1st row are worth 10 points, questions on the 2nd row are worth 20 points, questions on the 3rd row are worth 30 points.

-if you decide to not answer a question once you click the rectangle, you will lose the ability to click that rectangle/question again.

-The game is over once you reach 100 points. You will get a Sweet Alert saying "YOU WIN!"</h5>
